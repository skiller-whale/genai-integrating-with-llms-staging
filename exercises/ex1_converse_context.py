# Exercise 1 - `invoke` and context
#
# Part 1. Managing context
#
#    * The code below asks the LLM who the king of Sweden is.
#    * Use `messages.append(...)` to extract the answer and add the follow up:
#       'What about England?'
#    * Call `invoke` and make sure you get an appropriate response.
#
#    You should have the following message history at the end:
#       user: Who is the king of Sweden?
#       llm: <answer>
#       user: What about England?
#
#    * [Optional] What happens if you pass only the last message ('What about England?').
#
# Part 2. Pretending you're the LLM
#
#    * Create a new list of messages and ask any question as the user, for example:
#       How many minutes in an hour?
#       How do I boil an egg?
#    * Now add an answer, _pretending_ to be the assistant. Do this in the style of a pirate (or in any other particular style of speech you prefer):
#       {'role': 'assistant', 'content': [{'text': 'Yarr, Matey, there be 60 minutes in an hour!'}]}
#    * Add another message, asking a follow-up question and run `invoke`.
#    * Does the LLM respect the speech style you used for the assistant response - e.g. does it talk like a pirate?
#


# Version 1 - using dicts
conversation = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': [{'text': 'Answer any questions briefly.'}]},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': [{'text': 'Who is the king of Sweden?'}]}
]

# Part 1
response = model.invoke(conversation)
response.pretty_print()
